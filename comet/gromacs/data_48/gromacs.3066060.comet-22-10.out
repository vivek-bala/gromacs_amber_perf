Unloading compiler-dependent module openmpi_ib/1.8.4
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PMI2 initialized but returned bad values for size and rank.
This is symptomatic of either a failure to use the
"--mpi=pmi2" flag in SLURM, or a borked PMI2 installation.
If running under SLURM, try adding "-mpi=pmi2" to your
srun command line. If that doesn't work, or if you are
not running under SLURM, try removing or renaming the
pmi2.h header file so PMI2 support will not automatically
be built, reconfigure and build OMPI, and then try again
with only PMI1 support enabled.

NOTE 1 [file run.mdp]:
  You are using geometric combination rules in LJ-PME, but your non-bonded
  C6 parameters do not follow these rules. This will introduce very small
  errors in the forces and energies in your simulations. If your system is
  homogeneous, consider using dispersion correction for the total energy
  and pressure.

Estimate for the relative computational load of the PME mesh part: 0.37
